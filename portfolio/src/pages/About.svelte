            I grew up in Juneau Alaska until moving to Spokane, WA to pursue a computer science degree at Gonzaga University. I attribute my interest in programming to my involvement in the FIRST robotics programs starting in elementary school, culminating in my senior year in high school where my team won our state competition to qualify for the worlds competition in Houston, TX. I was never the programmer in robotics so I always thought I wanted to be an engineer until I took an AP computer science course my senior year of high school. After taking that class I knew I wanted to learn more.

            I graduated May 2023 with a B.S in Computer Science along with a Minor in Mathematics. I&apos;m currently still living in Spokane, enjoying my free time working on some projects while I search for a job.

            My biggest interests when it comes to computer science are web development and game development. My senior design project that I spent my senior year at Gonzaga working on required me to learn and use React, which has now prompted me to re-make my website to what you are seeing now. I&apos;m a big fan of pixel art and absolutely love fishing games, so I decided to have a little fun with the design. I&apos;m also working on a rhythm fishing game with a friend from back home that we hope to have a working demo completed by the end of the summer. Some of my favorite games that are inspirations to me for this game are rock band, stardew valley, and dredge.

            Outside of programming, I spend a lot of my time playing ultimate frisbee, disc golfing, and in the gym. I recently joined a club Ultimate team in Spokane that I am stoked about and I&apos;ve been getting in some casual disc golf as a break from working on my projects.
