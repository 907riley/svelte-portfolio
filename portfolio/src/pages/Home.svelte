        This May 2023 I graduated college with a degree in computer science with no employment lined up and in a slight state of panic. Throughout my time in college, professors and advisors had told me how important it was to apply early and have something lined up right out of college. That there was a formula to getting a good paying job in this industry: get internships during the summers leading up to your senior year and that will equal a job post college. I got those internships (which is why I am only slightly panicked when it comes to funds) and thoroughly enjoyed them, but they did not land me that job. So now what?

        I realized that I just spent four years learning about programming and I finally have the time to utilize my skills for what I want to do. I&apos;ve been spending my time working on fun projects like this website that I built with Next.js (which is definitely overkill for a simple website like this but I wanted to become familiar with it). I&apos;ve also been having a ton of fun working with a close friend on a video game. We&apos;ve been using Unity along with Blender to develop a rhythm fishing game called Jig. Once we have a working demo I will provide access to it here, but in the meantime I will leave it at that. I wrote more about these on my about page and left my email on that page if you would like to reach out to me.

        The goal of this website was not to create the paradigm of computer science portfolios where I strive for the sleekest looking UI. I just wanted it to stand out and to be fun to make.
