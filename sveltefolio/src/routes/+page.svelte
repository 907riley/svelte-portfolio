        First update of the new year! I recently decided to chop my hair that I’d been growing out for almost two years. My goal was to be able to put it back into a ponytail and I achieved that which was fun, but I started to quickly get tired of it getting in the way. It also took forever to air dry after showering. So now I have my normal short hair back and it feels so much better.

        In terms of game development, I decided to drop or at least put my Show Off game on hold. I was getting quite frustrated working on it and it became a lot less enjoyable to work on. Someone else released a very similar game to what I had envisioned which was a little demoralizing. I can see myself picking it back up one day when I have more experience working with the Godot engine and 3D in general, but for now it is sidelined. I am working on a new project with a friend that we intend on releasing on Steam at some point. I might post some stuff about it at some point, but for now I’m going to leave it at that.

        I’m going to be doing some dev logs under the Projects/Current pages, so go read about it to learn what I’ve been working on.
