        Summer is over and the best part of the year is officially here: fall. I didn’t always have this opinion though, as fall growing up in Juneau consisted of non stop rain, wind warnings, and barely any leaves (most of the trees are coniferous). So when I first got to experience fall in Spokane (after the way too hot summers we get here), I was pleasantly surprised. Fall is also home to the best holiday: Halloween. I’m a big horror movie fan and there is no better time to watch some spooky movies than during fall in October.

        On top of it being the best time of the year, I finally got a job. I accepted a job as a Systems Test Engineer at Itron where I’ve been learning how to work with different IoT devices. There’s definitely a learning curve with the size of the solution, but I will get to learn a lot about networking which is awesome. So far I’ve been really enjoying it and I’m very grateful for the opportunity during a time when the job market seems so dull. I also just got two kittens which has been so fun. They don’t always make the best decision, like sneaking up behind and jumping in the toilet when I’m going to the bathroom or coming to the conclusion that my bare legs would make good climbing material, but we still love them.

        In terms of game development, I’m currently working on a small and large project. I was originally just working on my large project, but I decided that I should try to make a smaller game to get more comfortable with Godot and the game development process before diving head first into a multi-year long project. The large project (which I’m purposely not mentioning the idea yet), is a game that I view as my perfect game that combines aspects of all my favorite games. It’s definitely become a victim to a bit of scope creep and I’ve done my best to restrain that, but I think it's best that I give that idea more time to simmer. The smaller project on the other hand is a game that I’m calling Show Off for now. The idea of the game is a 3rd person speed climbing game where the player has to control just the characters hands and arms to climb a rock wall as fast as they can. The player won’t be able to use the characters legs because they’re a bit of a show off.

        I’m going to be doing some dev logs under the Projects/Current pages, so go read about it to learn what I’ve been working on.
