        It’s official, my girlfriend and I have moved to the Seattle area for an amazing job opportunity she was offered. Moving over here in the future was an idea we had played around with, but always thought it would happen in 5 years or so, not months. But when an opportunity like this one presents itself, sometimes it’s best to get out of your comfort zone and hold on for the ride (this also sums up my experience driving a packed uhaul across the state on the subpar roads). So far we have both been loving our new place and the surrounding area.

        I did have to leave my job at Itron as I wasn’t able to continue working remotely. It was tough to say goodbye to all my coworkers that I had gotten to know, since I had only recently started there late last year, but it was the right decision. I learned a lot working there and would definitely recommend it to anyone in the Spokane/Liberty Lake area looking for a tech related job in a great community environment. This also means that I’m back in the market for a job. So if you know of any software engineering positions (or related fields) that need filling, don’t be shy to reach out. As of writing this on April 23rd, I have applied to just over 200 jobs. Hopefully all the time applying to jobs starts to bear fruit or I might have to get creative.
