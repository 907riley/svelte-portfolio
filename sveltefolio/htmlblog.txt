            As I’ve been getting more interested in game development, the idea of creating dev logs has become increasingly appealing to me. They seem to be a great way to not only update your community about the development of your game, but always a perfect way to build that community over time while keeping yourself accountable. On the other hand, creating dev logs takes away from the already limited game dev time of someone who works a full time day job like myself. I’m always so impressed by indie game developers who consistently post high quality video dev logs. So to save time I plan on posting my dev blogs in text format here on my website.

            The primary goal of these dev logs is to keep myself accountable towards actually seeing this idea through to fruition, people reading them would be a bonus hahaha. I think a realistic goal would be to post at least one dev log a month. If things speed up and I’m feeling ambitious, there might be more but don’t get your hopes up.
